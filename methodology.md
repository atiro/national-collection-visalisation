# Methodology

Please Note: This is a work in progress and this methodology may be reviewed.

The institutions used for this work are taken from the report '' with the
addition of the National Library of Scotland.

## Data sources (websites/annual reports)

For each institution, the website for the institution was searched for. From
the information on the website the institution was placed into a:

  * A sector
  * A topic (mixed if more than one topic)
  * A type of institution (museum, library, archive, university)

Of course, by picking a single topic for a large institution, this may
miss out on some very large areas of the institutions collection on 
another topic. To try to give a wider view, sub-collections are also able 
to have different topics and there are presentations of the data at the 
sub-collections level. 

## Sub-collections

Sub-collections are sometimes fairly clearly delineated by the institution
 itself, either where a instutition is formed
of multiple smaller instutitions, or states it is formed of a set of collections. Other times a personal decision has been made as to whether to sub-collections
exist. Sub-collections could be taken down to the department level as well,
but this would require a large amount of work and understanding of each
institutions structure that is not always possible to discover from the
website.

## Artefacts

The first area of uncertainty is in how an institutions states the size of it's collection. The words artefacts, items, objects, records, images and so on are
all used and it is not clear if that refers to the physical objects in it's
collections; to the records of the objects; to museum objects only or all items (museum, library, archives); and so on. Some institutions will include millions
of archive items in their number of artefacts, others with larger collections
do not include archives items in their figures so appear to have fewer
"artefacts". Until some standard lightweight agreenment on how these sizes
could be presented is settled on, it is 

## Records

To retrieve counts of how many catalogued objects a museum hold, if a figure
is stated in the annual report or on the website this is used (with all
the caveats as above for artefacts on how this figure can vary in meaning
between institutions).
