# Methodology

Please Note: This is a work in progress and this methodology may be reviewed.

The institutions used for this work are taken from the report -. 

## Data sources (websites/annual reports)

For each institution, the website for the institution was searched for. From
this website the institution was placed into:

  * A sector
  * A topic
  * A type

Of course, by placing a large institution into a single topic, this will
miss out on some very large areas of this institutions collection on 
another topic. For this reason, sub-collections are also able to have
different topics and there are presentations of the data at the 
sub-collections level. 

## Sub-collections

Sub-collections are sometimes fairly clearly delineated by the institution
 itself, either where a instutition is formed
of multiple smaller instutitions, or states it is formed of a set of collections. Other times a personal decision has been made as to whether to sub-collections
exist. Sub-collections could be taken down to the department level as well,
but this would require a large amount of work and understanding of each
institutions structure that is not always possible to discover from the
website.

## Artefacts

The first area of uncertainty is in how an institutions states the size of it's collection. The words artefacts, items, objects, records, images and so on are
all used and it is not clear if that refers to the physical objects in it's
collections; to the records of the objects; to museum objects only or all items (museum, library, archives); and so on. Some institutions will include millions
of archive items in their number of artefacts, others with larger collections
do not include archives items in their figures so appear to have fewer
"artefacts". Until some standard lightweight agreenment on how these sizes
could be presented is settled on, it is 

## Records

To retrieve counts of how many catalogued objects a museum hold, if a figure
is stated in the annual report or on the website this is used (with all
the caveats as above for artefacts on how this figure can vary in meaning
between institutions).
