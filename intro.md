Treemap diagram showing by area what percentage of the UK National Collection is contributed by each institution (with many caveats)
:::


The above areamap and the following notebooks are an optimistic attempt to 
visualise the extent of the UK National Collection of 'Artefacts'. That is,
everything in the collections of museums, libraries, galleries and archives
(and some houses and castles and gardens as well) of the UK and the extent
to which it has been catalogued (or not), digitised (or not), and made 
available online (or not). And with further updates, to chart progress
towards the goal over time over making more (all seems too final) of it available 
online as part of a national collection, in whatever form that takes.

The list of 216 institutions considered is taken from the report commisioned by the 
'Towards a National Collection' project -

The statistics presented here in various forms are taken from the institutions
collections websites (where available). A huge amount of personal 
interpretation has been taken after carrying out a brief review of the website or annual report, 
interpretation needed because of the variety of ways collections can be arranged,
counted and understood; because of the lack of definition of the words artefacts, collections,
items, objects, archives and because of the vaguaries of how records are made searchable online. Additionally
there are three huge issues with interpreting the above diagram:

  * Collections holding natural history specimens
  * Library Collections
  * Archives

For the first two the issue is of scale, they contains collections a magnitude larger in size than most other
types of collections, which affects any visalisations trying to bring all collections together.  For archives 
the question is of scale but also what has been catalogued and how, archival documents tending not to be catalogued
down to the item level due to the quantity, so often the measurement given is of archival collections or shelf space, which
cannot be drawn on the same visualisation. 

## Further Work

  * Digitisation statistics - how many artefacts hae been digitsed in some form (a picture, a 3D scan, etc)
  * Dealing with archives properly (and apologies as always to archivists for defering their problems until later)
  * Optionally seperating out specimens and non-special collection library items from all charts
  * Updates showing progress in cataloguing/digitisation - comparing now with then
  * Providing scorecard of how accessible each collection is and how easy it is to retrieve latest statistics
  * Providing a simple standard way for marking collection size available to aid in this work
