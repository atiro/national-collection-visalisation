The above areamap and the following notebooks are an optimistic attempt to 
visualise the extent of the UK National Collection of 'Artefacts'. That is,
everything in the collections of museums, libraries, galleries and archives
(and some houses and castles and gardens as well) of the UK and the extent
to which it has been catalogued (or not), digitised (or not), and made 
available online (or not). And with further updates, to chart progress
towards the goal over time over making more (all seems too final) of it available 
online as part of a national collection, in whatever form that takes.

The list of 216 institutions considered is taken from the report commisioned by the 
'Towards a National Collection' project -

## Further Work

  * Digitisation statistics - how many artefacts hae been digitsed in some form (a picture, a 3D scan, etc)
  * Dealing with archives properly (and apologies as always to archivists for defering their problems until later)
  * Optionally seperating out specimens and non-special collection library items from all charts if desired
  * Updates showing progress - comparing now with then
